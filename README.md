# AWS Containers Retail Sample

This is a sample application designed to illustrate various concepts related to containers on AWS. It presents a sample retail store application including a product catalog, shopping cart and checkout.

**This project is intended for educational purposes only and not for production use.**

## Application Architecture

The application has been deliberately over-engineered to generate multiple de-coupled components. These components generally have different infrastructure dependencies, and may support multiple "backends" (example: Carts service supports MongoDB or DynamoDB).

## Quickstart

The following sections provide quickstart instructions for various platforms. All of these assume that you have cloned this repository locally and are using a CLI thats current directory is the root of the code repository.

### Docker Compose

This deployment method will run the application on your local machine using `docker-compose`, and will build the containers as part of the deployment.

Pre-requisites:
- Docker and Docker Compose installed locally

Change directory to the Docker Compose deploy directory:

```
cd deploy/docker-compose
```

Use `docker-compose` to run the application containers:
